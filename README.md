## The Concept
Traditional paper-based record keeping systems in healthcare can be time-consuming, error-prone, and can lead to delays in emergency situations. Additionally, patient identification can be a challenge, leading to medical errors and decreased quality of care. This can result in negative patient outcomes and can lead to increased healthcare costs. There is a need for a more efficient and accurate patient record keeping system that can improve patient care, reduce errors, and ultimately save lives. Meditrack proposes a smart health record keeping system that utilizes the latest facial recognition and fingerprint technology to accurately and securely identify patients, reduce the reliance on paper-based systems, and provide a more sustainable healthcare environment.

## Solution
Meditrack app proposes a smart health record keeping system that utilizes facial recognition and fingerprint technology to accurately and securely identify patients in healthcare facilities. This system eliminates the need for traditional paper-based identification methods, reducing the potential for errors and delays in emergency situations. By using cutting-edge technology, patient records can be managed more efficiently and medical staff can access critical information quickly, resulting in improved patient care and reduced healthcare costs. Additionally, this system provides an added layer of security to ensure patient information remains confidential and protected at all times. Overall, the smart health record keeping system has the potential to revolutionize patient record keeping and improve healthcare outcomes.
